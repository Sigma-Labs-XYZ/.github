Sigma Labs was founded on two core beliefs:

> **Exceptional talent is missed every day**
>
> Opportunity is not equally distributed. The common heuristics used to judge graduates, such as the university they attended, overlook significant amounts of genuine talent. We rigorously source this talent while pushing the boundaries of assessment. This is the first half of our mission.

> **Exceptional training changes outcomes**
>
> The most effective learning practices are rarely used: institutions that invest in training – e.g. schools, universities, and educational agencies – are often not rewarded for the quality of the output, so the incentives don’t align. Yet Benjamin Bloom’s seminal educational research proved that the right methods can change learning outcomes by 2 standard deviations (2 sigmas). This is monumental; while the research has advanced, these and many other techniques are at the core of what we do: thus the second half of our mission.

**We exist to solve this problem.** We hire outstanding graduates, amplify with exceptional training and help clients excel with software, data and cloud talent.
